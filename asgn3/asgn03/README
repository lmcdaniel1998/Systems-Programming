Functionality
-------------

This assignment is composed of two seperate programs: hencode 
and hdecode. The purpose of these programs is to compress a 
file and decompress it later.

hencode is designed to encode a file and output the compressed
file to either stdout or a specified file.

hdecode is designed to decode a file and output the decompressed
contents to either stdout or a specified file.

Currently this program has some trouble when decompressing larger
files.  Randomly small chunks of text or words will be decoded
wrongly and random characters will appear in in place. It does
not happen often in larger files but it is still a bad decode.
When building my huffman tree I was unable to implement it in the
same manner as specified in the assigment so I could not use the 
provided tests to test my project.

Usage
-----

This program is intedned to be compiled an run in a 
Unix shell enviornment. The following steps must be made in 
order to run thisprogram.

	1. Place all of the program files in the same folder.

	2. Type "make all" into the command line to compile
	   all of the files.

	3. To encode a file type the following into the
	   command line: 
           "./hencode [file to be encoded] {optional file to write to}".

	4. When decodeing, be sure to pass hdecode a file
	   that has been encoded with this hencode program or
	   it will not decode properly. To decode type the
	   following into the command line: 
	  "./hdecode [file to be decoded] {optional file to write to}".
