Functionality

This program is named parseline. Its purpose is to take in
commands from the user and eventually pass it to mush
(minimally useful shell). Currently it separates all
commands and arguements and using pipes and redirections
specifies the input and output of each command in a pipeline.

This command line parser has a few hard limit that you cannot exceed.

	1. Whole command line length cannot be longer than 512 bytes.

	2. There can be no more than 10 commands in a pipeline.

	3. Each command can have no more than 10 arguments.
